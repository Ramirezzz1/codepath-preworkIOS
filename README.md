I would like to create a fitness tracker similar to my fitness pal. I used to love the app but since they implemented a 20 dollar monthly subscription fee I refuse to use it anymore. I loved
how the app had a barcode scanner that allowed to upload the nutrition information with a quick scan. The app also kept track of your daily weigh ins and displayed them to you in a line graph.
